# Introduction
Hi, I'm Zhongzhen. 
In my undergraduate studies, I majored in mathematics. During that time, most of my coursework delved into pure theoretical knowledge, and I took numerous courses heavily focused on abstract mathematical concepts. However, I found limited opportunities to apply what I had learned to real-world scenarios.

Discovering fields like geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing has been incredibly rewarding for me. Casa and remote sensing  offer abundant opportunities to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications. 

My interest lies in optimizing spatial problems. This passion stems from my undergraduate fascination with operational research, where I delved deep into the study of optimization techniques. Even I once considered pursuing operational research in my graduate studies.
