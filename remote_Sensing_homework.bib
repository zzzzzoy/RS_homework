	abstract = {Identification of an oil spill is additionally essential to evaluate the potential spread and float from the source to the adjacent coastal terrains. In such manner, usage of Synthetic Aperture {RADAR} ({SAR}) information for the recognition and checking of oil spills has gotten extensive consideration as of late, because of their wide zone inclusion, day-night and all-weather capabilities. The present examination studies an oil spill occurred in the Al Khafji region by applying Sentinel 1 {SAR}-C images. Al Khafji is on the borderline between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in the Persian Gulf and it is detected as an unbiased zone. Al Khafji region can possibly deliver in excess of 7472.403 m³ barrels of oil for every day (m³/d). Approaches dependent on multi-sensor satellite images examination have been produced for distinguishing oil spills from referred to common leaks just as oil slick procedures. In this paper, one of these techniques is associated with Sentinel 1 images of a known region of natural oil leakage and of an ongoing oil slick incident in Al Khafji zone. The Synthetic Aperture Radar ({SAR}) is perceived as the most significant remote sensing apparatus for the ocean and ocean waters oil slick examination, recording, documentation and propagation. Specifically, this paper examines oil spills recognition in the Persian Gulf surveyed by utilizing Sentinel-1 ({SAR}-C) imageries. Results demonstrated the significance of the {VV} polarization of the Sentinel-1 for recognizing oil-spills just as the diminished utility of the {VH} polarization in this sole circumstance.},

	abstract = {The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}), one of the earliest remote sensing analytical products used to simplify the complexities of multi-spectral imagery, is now the most popular index used for vegetation assessment. This popularity and widespread use relate to how an {NDVI} can be calculated with any multispectral sensor with a visible and a near-{IR} band. Increasingly low costs and weights of multispectral sensors mean they can be mounted on satellite, aerial, and increasingly—Unmanned Aerial Systems ({UAS}). While studies have found that the {NDVI} is effective for expressing vegetation status and quantified vegetation attributes, its widespread use and popularity, especially in {UAS} applications, carry inherent risks of misuse with end users who received little to no remote sensing education. This article summarizes the progress of {NDVI} acquisition, highlights the areas of {NDVI} application, and addresses the critical problems and considerations in using {NDVI}. Detailed discussion mainly covers three aspects: atmospheric effect, saturation phenomenon, and sensor factors. The use of {NDVI} can be highly effective as long as its limitations and capabilities are understood. This consideration is particularly important to the {UAS} user community.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing has frequently been employed to monitor extreme climatic events, especially droughts, by identifying the anomalies of vegetation activity from the regional to global scale. However, limited research has addressed the performance of remote sensing on detecting extreme precipitation events. By using the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River ({MLR}-{YR}) in China as an example, this paper examines the application of the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) for detecting the change of extreme precipitation events from 1982 to 2012. The performances of three {NDVI}-based indices, including minimum, mean, and maximum {NDVIs}, were examined to capture the sensibility of vegetation activity to changes in extreme precipitation events. The results show not only common enhanced trends, but also obvious spatial discrepancies between the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events in the {MLR}-{YR}. As to its application on terrestrial vegetation, changes in extreme precipitation intensity coincided with that of the vegetation activity, which was represented as the maximum and the minimum {NDVIs}, especially the maximum {NDVI}. In addition, similar patterns were found between the standard deviation of the maximum {NDVI} and the trend of extreme precipitation intensity. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients were relatively greater between the maximum {NDVI} and extreme precipitation intensity than that of the minimum {NDVI}. Our results support the hypothesis that maximum {NDVI} is more suited to capture the response of vegetation activity to extreme precipitation events in the {MLR}-{YR} region, in comparison to the other two {NDVI} indices.},

	abstract = {Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil?s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

This classifier has become popular within the remote sensing community due to the accuracy of its classifications. The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of {RF} classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that {RF} classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance ({VI}) measurement provided by the {RF} classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},
